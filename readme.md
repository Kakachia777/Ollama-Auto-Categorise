<h2>Setting Up Your Project in Google Cloud Console and Enabling APIs</h2>

<h3>Enabling Google Workspace APIs</h3>

<p>To enable Google Workspace APIs, follow these steps:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Go to the Google Cloud console and navigate to Menu > More products > Google Workspace > Product Library.</li>
  <li>Click on the API you want to enable and then click on the "Enable" button.</li>
  <li>You can also enable APIs using the Google Cloud Command Line Interface (CLI) by running the command `gcloud services enable <API_SERVICE_ID>`.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Creating and Managing Service Account Credentials for Google Sheets Access</h3>

<p>To create and manage service account credentials for Google Sheets access, you'll need to follow these steps:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Create a service account in the Google Cloud console.</li>
  <li>Generate a private key file for the service account.</li>
  <li>Use the private key file to authenticate with the Google Sheets API.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Integrating an Open-Source Language Model to Read and Categorize Each Row Based on Content</h3>

<p>To integrate an open-source language model with your Google Sheets API project, you'll need to:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Choose an open-source language model that fits your needs.</li>
  <li>Install the language model library and its dependencies.</li>
  <li>Write code to read data from Google Sheets using the Google Sheets API.</li>
  <li>Use the language model to categorize each row based on content.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Running the Entire Process Locally on Your Computer</h3>

<p>To run the entire process locally on your computer, you'll need to:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Install the required libraries and dependencies.</li>
  <li>Set up a local development environment.</li>
  <li>Write code to read data from Google Sheets using the Google Sheets API.</li>
  <li>Use the language model to categorize each row based on content.</li>
</ol>

<p>By following these steps, you can set up your project in Google Cloud Console, enable the necessary APIs, create and manage service account credentials, integrate an open-source language model, and run the entire process locally on your computer.</p>
